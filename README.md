## Overview
Secure File Transfer is a web application designed to securely encrypt, transfer, and decrypt files using modern cryptographic techniques. This project utilizes end-to-end encryption to ensure that files remain confidential and integral from the moment they are uploaded until they are downloaded and decrypted by the intended recipient.

This was a group project that was completed to explore the minimization of collected user metadata for cloud-based encrypted file transfer and partially fulfill the course requirements for CS 4930 - Privacy and Censorship at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.

## Features
- **File Encryption**: Files are encrypted client-side using the XChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm before being uploaded.
- **Secure File Upload and Download**: Files are transferred via presigned URLs generated by AWS S3, ensuring that files are never exposed to both the backend and unauthorized users.
- **Dynamic Decryption**: Files are decrypted client-side, ensuring that the decryption keys never leave the user's environment.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, js-cookie, React Router
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Cryptography**: libsodium-wrappers for encryption and decryption
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for file storage with presigned URLs
- **Deployment**: Docker
- **Web Server**: NGINX
